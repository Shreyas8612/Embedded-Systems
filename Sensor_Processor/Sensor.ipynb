Between these two processes they share a circular buffer/memory among others for ensuring sensed data are stored and processed without any potential hazards.\n",

        "Sensors in an IoT system continuously collect real-world data such as temperature, pressure, motion, or humidity. These sensors generate raw data in the form of electrical signals, which are then converted into digital values using an **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**. In this example, we will assume the details of ADC are masked and we are able to generate random sensing data for simulation purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sensor data is stored in a **shared memory** (in this case a circular buffer with a capacity of 10 data samples max). In our case, we will assume two sensors are writing data to this shared memory using synchronization mechanisms to prevent data corruption.  \n",

        "An **IoT processor** (which could be a microcontroller, edge device, or cloud server agent) retrieves this stored data, processes it (for example for filtering, anomaly detection, or machine learning models, and then interprets) for decision-making. This processed information is either **displayed to users**, **triggering an action**, or **transmitted to cloud services** for further analysis. In our example, we will just assume each data are arithmetically processed for data conditioning.\n",
